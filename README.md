A Python script to use Mistral AI to sort a given directory of images into subdirectories.

This is a final project for an "Intro to Artificial Intelligence" class. Don't expect long-term, professional support.

Current functionality: Iterate through a folder named "C:\Temp\Pictures\" and put each file into a folder named for a brief description of the file.

Future functionality: Change the target directory; choose from a list of pre-engineered sorting category prompts or input your own.

The following Python packages are prerequisites:

pip install pillow

pip install mistralai

pip install llama-index-multi-modal-llms-mistralai
